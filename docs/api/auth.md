## Authentication
API authentication is done via API key pairs generated through the UI. These keys are tied to specific user accounts and retain the same access-level privileges as the username/password pair.

Just like user accounts, the associated API keys can be enabled, disabled, and deleted.

### API Key Pairs
When the API is enabled, the **_Users & Groups_** page will have a section for _API Keys_.

![User Page API Keys](../images/api/UserPageAPIKeys.png)
Each user properties window will also have a link to create an API key pair.

![User Properties API Keys](../images/api/UserPropertiesAPIKeys.png)

Once the logged in user clicks **_Add New_**, a key pair will be generated and presented to the user.

![Created API Key Pair](../images/api/CreateAPIKey.png)

This key pair will be used to interact with the REST API.

!!! note
    The currently logged in user cannot create API key pairs for any other user.

### Usage

The key pair can be used by [`client.php`](./client.php.md) or any other typical means of interacting with a REST API.

#### `client.php`
After [client installation](../getting-started/basic-install.md#client-installation), add the following to /usr/local/facileManager/config.inc.php on your client(s) from where you want to use the API (substitute the actual values with your own).

```php
define('APIKEY', 'UH27EOM9EUELLUKRX0KDZEAWGN');
define('APISECRET', 'Lyznun1N4gQGILoHqweZLAhGyYrHCQQV7AuUN');
```

Alternatively, you may add the `APIKEY` and `APISECRET` variables to another file and reference it in your API calls with `client.php apicreds=/path/to/file ...`.

#### Other Client
You must pass these three keys in the headers of your request for authentication.

| Key | Description | Example Value |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| AUTHKEY | Account | `default` |
| X-API-KEY | API key for the user | `UH27EOM9EUELLUKRX0KDZEAWGN` |
| X-API-SECRET | API secret for the user | `Lyznun1N4gQGILoHqweZLAhGyYrHCQQV7AuUN` |
