## Overview
Use REST APIs to create, list, modify, and delete resources in facileManager modules from within programs and scripts.

Current modules that support API actions:

* fmDNS

You can automate some tasks that are usually performed manually using the UI.

The REST APIs can be accessed via applications or scripts that support the following request methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `POST` | Create new resources |
| `PATCH` | Update existing resources |
| `DELETE` | Delete existing resources |

In addition, [`client.php`](./client.php.md) can be used to access the API. This client can often be easier to setup and provides the common functions a user requires.

### Setup
REST APIs are part of the facileManager installation and can be used once enabled in **_Settings â†’ General_**.

Once the API is enabled, [create the key pairs](./auth.md).
